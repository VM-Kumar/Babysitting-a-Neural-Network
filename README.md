the content is organized as follows:

1. [description_report.pdf](https://github.com/VM-Kumar/Babysitting-a-Neural-Network/blob/main/description_report.pdf) : detailed report on steps taken and results obtained on chosen face dataset.
2. [final_code.ipynb](https://github.com/VM-Kumar/Babysitting-a-Neural-Network/blob/main/final_code.ipynb) : final code for all steps mention in the description report. The dataset used was organized as 4 folders:dataset_face_train,dataset_nonface_train,dataset_face_test,dataset_nonface_test having 1000,1000,100,100 images respectively. This project was designed to classify an image as face or non face(binary). But the code can be modified for any other dataset with mild modifications in. To run the code give the path to dataset as given in code comment or modify code only for the data acquisition part according to custom dataset.
3. [final_code.py](https://github.com/VM-Kumar/Babysitting-a-Neural-Network/blob/main/final_code.py) : python code of above notebook.
